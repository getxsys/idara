## Test Scripts

The following npm scripts are available:

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test                    # Run all Jest tests
npm run test:watch             # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage          # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:unit              # Run unit tests only
npm run test:integration       # Run integration tests only

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e               # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui            # Run E2E tests with UI
npm run test:performance       # Run performance tests
npm run test:accessibility     # Run accessibility tests

# All tests
npm run test:all               # Run all test suites
```

## Performance Thresholds

The following performance thresholds are enforced:

- API Response: 500ms
- Database Query: 100ms
- UI Render: 16ms (60fps)
- Search Query: 200ms
- AI Processing: 2000ms
- File Upload: 5000ms

## Accessibility Standards

Tests ensure compliance with:

- WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- Touch target sizes (44x44px minimum)
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes and landmarks

## Coverage Goals

- Unit Test Coverage: 80%+ line coverage
- Integration Test Coverage: All API endpoints
- E2E Test Coverage: All critical user journeys
- Accessibility Coverage: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Performance Coverage: All major user interactions

## Quality Gates

The CI pipeline enforces the following quality gates:

1. All tests must pass
2. Code coverage must meet minimum thresholds
3. No critical accessibility violations
4. Performance thresholds must be met
5. Security audit must pass
6. Linting and type checking must pass

## Monitoring and Reporting

- Test results are reported in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, JUnit)
- Coverage reports are uploaded to Codecov
- Performance metrics are tracked over time
- Accessibility violations are documented and tracked
- Failed tests generate detailed reports with screenshots and traces

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in any order
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: External services are mocked for reliable testing
3. **Realistic Test Data**: Use realistic mock data that represents actual usage
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics to catch regressions
5. **Accessibility First**: Test accessibility from the beginning, not as an afterthought
6. **Continuous Testing**: Tests run on every commit and pull request
7. **Clear Test Names**: Test names clearly describe what is being tested
8. **Comprehensive Error Testing**: Test both success and failure scenarios

This comprehensive testing infrastructure ensures the Modern Business Dashboard maintains high quality, performance, and accessibility standards throughout development and deployment.
