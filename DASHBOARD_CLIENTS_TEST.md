# Dashboard Clients Page Test

## Overview
Testing the main dashboard clients page at `/dashboard/clients` to ensure proper toast notifications appear when deleting clients instead of navigation errors.

## Test URL
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/clients`

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Added Toast Notifications
- Added `useToast` hook to the main dashboard page
- Success toast appears when client is deleted
- Error toast appears if deletion fails
- Success toast appears when client is created

### 2. Prevented Navigation Issues
- Added `stopPropagation()` to dropdown menu items to prevent row clicks
- Added `stopPropagation()` to dropdown trigger button
- Updated delete handler to remove client from local state immediately
- Updated client service to use API endpoints consistently

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better error messages for failed operations
- Proper error handling in client service
- Consistent API usage across all operations

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/clients`
2. You should see the main clients dashboard with a table of clients
3. If no clients exist, create one using the "Add Client" button

### Step 2: Test Client Creation
1. Click "Add Client" button
2. Fill in the form with test data
3. Submit the form
4. **Expected**: Success toast appears: "Client Created: [Name] has been successfully created."
5. **Expected**: New client appears in the table

### Step 3: Test Client Deletion
1. Find a client in the table
2. Click the three dots (⋯) menu button in the Actions column
3. Click "Delete Client" from the dropdown
4. **Expected**: Delete confirmation dialog appears
5. Click "Delete Client" button in the dialog
6. **Expected**: 
   - Success toast appears: "Client Deleted: [Name] has been successfully deleted."
   - Client disappears from the table
   - No navigation to "Failed to load client" page occurs
   - You remain on the `/dashboard/clients` page

### Step 4: Test Other Actions
1. Click the three dots menu for another client
2. Click "View Details"
3. **Expected**: Navigate to client detail page
4. Go back to clients list
5. Click "Edit Client" from dropdown
6. **Expected**: Navigate to client edit page

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Cases
- **Client Deletion**: Toast notification appears, client removed from list, no navigation
- **Client Creation**: Toast notification appears, client added to list
- **View Details**: Navigate to client detail page
- **Edit Client**: Navigate to client edit page
- **Error Handling**: Error toasts appear for failed operations

### ❌ What Should NOT Happen
- No navigation to "Failed to load client" page after deletion
- No blank pages or error pages after successful operations
- No missing toast notifications

## Debugging

### Console Logs to Watch For
When deleting a client, you should see:
```
Dashboard: Deleting client with ID: [client-id]
Dashboard: Client deleted successfully
```

### Network Tab
- DELETE request to `/api/clients/[id]` should return 200 OK
- No unexpected navigation requests

### Toast Verification
- Toast should appear in top-right corner
- Toast should auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Toast should have green background for success messages

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still Getting "Failed to load client" Page
**Cause**: Row click is still triggering navigation
**Solution**: Check that `stopPropagation()` is working on dropdown items

### Issue 2: No Toast Appears
**Cause**: Toast context not available or error in toast system
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify ToastProvider is in layout

### Issue 3: Client Not Removed from List
**Cause**: Local state not updated or API call failed
**Solution**: Check network tab for API response, check console for errors

## API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/clients` - Fetch all clients
- `POST /api/clients` - Create new client
- `DELETE /api/clients/[id]` - Delete client

All endpoints should return proper HTTP status codes and JSON responses.
