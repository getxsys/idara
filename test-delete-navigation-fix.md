# Delete Navigation Fix Test

## Issue
When deleting a client, user gets redirected to "Failed to load client" page instead of seeing toast confirmation.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was likely caused by:
1. Potential navigation to client detail page after deletion
2. Race condition between dialog closing and callback execution
3. Possible row-level click handlers interfering with delete action

## Fixes Applied

### 1. DeleteClientDialog.tsx
- Close dialog before executing callback to prevent navigation issues
- Added small delay to ensure dialog is properly closed
- Improved error handling sequence

### 2. SimpleClientList.tsx
- Added history.replaceState to prevent any pending navigation
- Added explicit row click prevention with preventDefault and stopPropagation
- Enhanced client deletion callback with navigation protection

### 3. Event Handling
- Ensured all button clicks have proper event prevention
- Added row-level click prevention to avoid unintended navigation

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/test-crud` page
2. Create a test client
3. Click delete button on the client
4. Confirm deletion in dialog
5. Verify:
   - Client is removed from list
   - Toast notification appears with success message
   - No navigation to "Failed to load client" page occurs
   - User remains on the same page

## Expected Behavior
- Client should be deleted successfully
- Toast message should appear: "Client Deleted: [Client Name] has been successfully deleted."
- User should remain on the current page
- No navigation to client detail page should occur
