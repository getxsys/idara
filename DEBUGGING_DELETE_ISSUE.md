# Debugging Client Delete Issue

## Problem
When deleting a client, instead of showing a toast message, the user gets redirected to a "Failed to load client" page.

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Verify You're on the Correct Page
1. Make sure you're accessing: `http://localhost:3000/test-crud`
2. Check the URL in the browser address bar
3. The page should show "Client CRUD Operations Test" as the title

### Step 2: Open Browser Developer Tools
1. Press F12 to open developer tools
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Clear any existing logs

### Step 3: Test the Toast System First
1. Click on a client's delete button
2. In the delete dialog, click the "Test Toast" button (blue button)
3. You should see a test toast appear in the top-right corner
4. If the test toast doesn't appear, there's an issue with the toast system

### Step 4: Test Client Deletion
1. Click on a client's delete button
2. Click the red "Delete Client" button
3. Watch the console logs - you should see:
   ```
   === DELETE CLIENT HANDLER START ===
   Current URL: http://localhost:3000/test-crud
   handleClientDeleted called with clientId: [some-id]
   Found deleted client: [client object]
   Updated clients list, new length: [number]
   Current path before replaceState: /test-crud
   About to show success toast for: [client name]
   Toast shown successfully
   === DELETE CLIENT HANDLER END ===
   ```

### Step 5: Check Network Tab
1. Go to the Network tab in developer tools
2. Delete a client
3. Look for:
   - DELETE request to `/api/clients/[id]` (should be 200 OK)
   - Any unexpected GET requests to client detail pages

### Step 6: Check for Navigation
1. After clicking delete, check if the URL changes
2. The URL should remain: `http://localhost:3000/test-crud`
3. If it changes to something like `/dashboard/clients/[id]`, that's the problem

## Possible Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Wrong Page
**Problem**: You're not on the `/test-crud` page but on `/dashboard/clients`
**Solution**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test-crud`

### Issue 2: Toast Context Not Working
**Problem**: Toast context is not properly set up
**Symptoms**: Test toast button doesn't work
**Solution**: Check if ToastProvider is in the root layout

### Issue 3: Navigation Override
**Problem**: Some parent component is overriding the delete behavior
**Symptoms**: URL changes after deletion
**Solution**: Check console logs for navigation prevention messages

### Issue 4: API Error
**Problem**: Delete API is failing
**Symptoms**: Error messages in console, no success logs
**Solution**: Check network tab for API response

## Expected Behavior
1. Click delete button → Delete dialog opens
2. Click "Test Toast" → Toast appears (confirms toast system works)
3. Click "Delete Client" → Console shows all debug logs
4. URL remains `/test-crud`
5. Success toast appears: "Client Deleted: [Name] has been successfully deleted."
6. Client disappears from the list

## If Issue Persists
If you're still getting redirected to "Failed to load client":

1. Check what URL you're being redirected to
2. Look for any error messages in the console
3. Verify the DELETE API request is successful
4. Check if there are any global navigation listeners
5. Try refreshing the page and testing again

## Test Commands
You can also test the API directly:
```bash
# Test delete API (replace [client-id] with actual ID)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/clients/[client-id]
```
