# Debug Delete Issue

## Current Problem
When deleting a client, instead of showing a toast message, the user gets redirected to a "Failed to load client" page.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
When you delete a client, check the browser console for these logs:
- "Delete button clicked for client:"
- "Deleting client:"
- "API Response status:"
- "API Success:"
- "handleClientDeleted called with clientId:"
- "Found deleted client:"
- "Updated clients list, new length:"
- "Showing success toast for:"

### 2. Check Network Tab
- Verify the DELETE request to `/api/clients/[id]` is successful (200 status)
- Check if there are any unexpected navigation requests

### 3. Check Current URL
- Before deletion: Should be `/test-crud`
- After deletion: Should still be `/test-crud` (not redirected)

### 4. Check Toast Appearance
- Toast should appear in top-right corner
- Should show "Client Deleted: [Client Name] has been successfully deleted."

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Form Submission
If the delete button is inside a form, it might be submitting the form instead of just calling the onClick handler.

### Issue 2: Event Bubbling
Click events might be bubbling up to parent elements that have navigation handlers.

### Issue 3: Router Navigation
Some parent component might be listening for client changes and triggering navigation.

### Issue 4: Toast Context Not Available
The toast context might not be properly available in the component tree.

## Testing Instructions

1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to `/test-crud` page
3. Create a test client
4. Click delete button
5. Confirm deletion
6. Watch console logs and network tab
7. Check if toast appears or if navigation occurs

## Expected Behavior
- Console logs should show all the debug messages
- No navigation should occur
- Toast should appear with success message
- Client should be removed from the list
